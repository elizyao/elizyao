Elizabeth has performed as a guest soloist with the Coeur d’Alene Symphony as a winner of the Coeur d’Alene Symphony Young Artists Competition, and has also won prizes and honors in several other competitions, including the Lima Symphony Orchestra Young Artist Competition, the University of Washington Annual Concerto Competition, and the Ladies Musical Club Award Tour Competition. In 2017, she was a guest on Spokane Public Radio’s “From the Studio” program for a live performance and interview.
